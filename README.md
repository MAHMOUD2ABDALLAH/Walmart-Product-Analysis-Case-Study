## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive sales analytics for Walmart's retail operations across the United States. The interactive executive dashboard transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence, enabling data-driven decision making for sales performance, regional analysis, and product category optimization.

## Business Objectives

The dashboard addresses key business questions:
- Sales Performance: Track total sales, profit, and margins across time periods
- Geographic Analysis: Identify top-performing states and regions
- Product Performance: Analyze category and sub-category profitability
- Customer Insights: Understand customer segments and buying patterns
- Operational Efficiency: Monitor return rates and shipping performance

## Data Sources

- Primary Dataset: Walmart sales transactions (2016-2019)
- Geographic Data: US States coordinates for mapping visualization
- Date Intelligence: Custom calendar table for time-based analysis

## Data Model Architecture

Built using a Star Schema for optimal performance:

### Fact Tables
- `Walmart` - Core sales transactions with 400+ records

### Dimension Tables
- `Calendar` - Custom date table with comprehensive time intelligence
- `US_States` - Geographic coordinates for mapping visualizations

### Key Relationships
- `Walmart[Order Date]` -> `Calendar[DateKey]` (Active)
- `Walmart[Ship Date]` -> `Calendar[DateKey]` (Inactive)
- `Walmart[State]` -> `US_States[State]`

## Key Metrics & KPIs

### Financial Performance
- Total Sales: Sum of all sales transactions
- Total Profit: Net profit across all orders
- Profit Margin: Profit as percentage of sales
- YoY Growth: Year-over-year sales growth percentage

### Operational Metrics
- Return Rate: Percentage of returned orders
- Average Shipping Days: Order to delivery time
- Quantity Sold: Total units moved

### Customer & Product Analytics
- Orders by Segment: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
- Category Performance: Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology
- Regional Contribution: Sales distribution across US regions

## Dashboard Features

### Interactive Visualizations
1. KPI Scorecards - Key metrics with conditional formatting
2. Sales Trend Analysis - Line and column charts for time series
3. Geographic Heat Map - State-level performance mapping
4. Product Category Analysis - Stacked bar charts and treemaps
5. Customer Segmentation - Top customers and segment performance
6. Dynamic Slicers - Year, Quarter, Region, Category filters

### Advanced Analytics
- Conditional Formatting: Color-coded KPIs based on performance thresholds

- Profitability Analysis: Margin analysis by product categories

## Technical Implementation

### Power BI Components
- Power Query: Data transformation and cleaning
- DAX Measures: 15+ calculated measures for business metrics
- Data Modeling: Star schema with optimized relationships
- Visualization: Interactive charts with drill-through capabilities

### Key DAX Measures
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM('Walmart'[Sales])
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Calendar'[DateKey])
YoY Growth = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [Sales PY], [Sales PY])
```
